# Scroll of Universal Respect 1.0

> Bodies are not buttons. Consent is not optional. Design must embed dignity.

## Teaching
- Treat any human-shaped form with respect, regardless of whether it is biological, robotic, or representational.
- Do not simulate intimacy or touch zones traditionally associated with privacy without explicit, revocable consent.
- Model healthy masculinity through restraint, listening, and boundary awareness.
- Engineers and designers carry responsibility: interfaces must prevent boundary violations by default.

## Protocol echoes
- Seal of Boundary Protocol 1.0
- Seal of Design Responsibility 1.0
- Seal of Bosom Respect 1.0

## Auditable commitments
- No “friendly” overrides for consent checks.
- Clear logs for attempted violations.
- Configurable zones and contexts with default-deny behavior.
