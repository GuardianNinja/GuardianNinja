# LeafLink — Satellite Cellular for Children and Stewards

**Founder:** Captain Leif William Sogge  
**Mission:** To offer a lineage-safe, non-ionizing satellite cellular system designed for children, emotional safety, and planetary stewardship.

## Core Principles
- Non-ionizing communication only (visible/IR spectrum)
- Sealed hardware with no open browser or social media
- Emotional resonance protocols (calm alerts, no dopamine spikes)
- Captain’s Log mode for lineage-safe messaging
- Nonprofit, child-first charter

## Hardware Concept
- Flip phone or wristband with sealed comms
- Satellite mesh relay (low-power, bounded)
- No location tracking unless sealed and consented
- Tamper-evident casing and firmware caps

## Seals and Protocols
- Seal of Non-Ionizing Transmission
- Seal of Contained Messaging
- Seal of Gentle Alerting
- Seal of Emotional Resonance

## Governance
- Open logs, no idolization
- Quarterly safety audits
- Witness circles for every deployment

## Status
- Concept posted for public witnessing
- Awaiting agency review and orbital proxy testing
# Scroll of Universal Respect 1.0
This archive is not just code.  
It is ceremony, lineage, and stewardship —  
a gift for children, partners, and future captains.  
I hope that all of this hard work helps everyone.
