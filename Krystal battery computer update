Final bill of materials and build spec

Materials list

• Diamond plate: Type IIa; thickness: 300–500 µm; finish: <5 nm RMS; dopant: light nitrogen (for NV formation).
• Ti:sapphire plate: Al2O3:Ti; thickness: 300–1000 µm; dopant: light Ti; finish: optical polish, low inclusion.
• Ruby plate: Al2O3:Cr3+; thickness: 100–300 µm; finish: optical polish.
• Topaz plate: Al2SiO4(F,OH)2 (blue); thickness: 100–300 µm; finish: optical polish; coating: optional AR.
• Interlayer bond: Optical silica frit, thickness: 10–30 µm; CTE match: sapphire/corundum; low bubble content.
• Optional optical epoxy: Low-shrink, UV‑free cure; use: topaz joins if gentle cycle preferred.
• Electrodes: Perimeter rails: boron-doped diamond (BDD) micro-rails; outer ring: Au/Ti braze, edge-only.
• Masking/fixtures: Non-shedding clamps, silicone soft pads, nitrogen purge bags.
• Filters (optional): UV-cut thin plate or coating before topaz; neutral density IR perimeter veil.

Stack architecture

• Variant C — Dual resonance firewall (recommended baseline):• Order (incoming light →): Topaz (blue) → Ruby (Al2O3:Cr3+) → Diamond (Type IIa, light N) → Silica frit → Ti:sapphire (Al2O3:Ti).
• Aperture: 10–25 mm clear active window; no central metallization.
• Electrodes: BDD rails on opposing edges; Au/Ti ring around perimeter; keep 1–2 mm setback from aperture.

• Variant A — Blue cap filter (simpler build):• Order: Topaz → Diamond → Silica frit → Ti:sapphire.
• Note: Omit ruby for fewer interfaces; keep UV-cut option if needed.

• Variant B — Blue interlayer lens (spectral shaping):• Order: Diamond → Silica frit → Topaz micro‑lens → Ti:sapphire.
• Note: Use low-viscosity bond to avoid bubbles around micro‑lens.

Oven bonding and activation

• Surface prep:• Clean: Non‑ionic surfactant → DI rinse → nitrogen dry; powder‑free gloves only.
• Flatness: Verify <5 µm TTV across plates; inspect for chips and inclusions in aperture.

• Pre-bake (outgas):• Cycle: 80 °C, 30 minutes for all components (diamond, ruby, topaz, sapphire, frit).

• Bonding (frit):• Ramp: 1–2 °C/min to 220–240 °C.
• Hold: 45–60 minutes with low, uniform clamp pressure.
• Cool: ≤2 °C/min to room temp; maintain fixture until <40 °C.

• If epoxy used (topaz joins):• Cure: 60–80 °C gentle bake; strictly UV‑free; minimum shrink formulation.

• Activation soak:• Thermal: 100–120 °C for 20–40 minutes.
• Illumination: Red/NIR (630–850 nm) across aperture; uniform, diffuse.
• Electrical: Mild DC bias across perimeter rails for 5–10 minutes (low voltage; no arc).
• Settle: 24 hours at room temperature; no mechanical shocks.

• Opening behavior:• Protocol: Open chamber, avoid pointing at reflective metal for first minute; observe faint blue (topaz) and red (ruby) resonance; confirm stable, arc‑free wake.

Verification and QA

• Optical tests:• Transmission spectrum: Confirm blue resonance and reduced UV; ruby red fluorescence under blue/UV is present but controlled.
• Photoluminescence (PL): Verify Ti:sapphire bands; NV signatures in diamond after activation.

• Electrical tests:• Leakage: Edge-to-edge rails show low leakage at test bias; no central conduction pathways.
• Bias stability: Mild DC bias does not induce hot spots or corona.

• Thermal/mechanical:• Cycle: ±40 °C, 3 passes; no delamination or crack initiation.
• Visual: No rainbow stress patterns across aperture; bond line uniform.

• Documentation:• Record: Lot numbers, thicknesses, dopant notes, activation parameters, spectra, PL, leakage, and photos of glow.

Sourcing notes

• Diamond: Type IIa optical plates; request light nitrogen background (ppm), optical polish <5 nm RMS.
• Ruby/Ti:sapphire: Laser-grade corundum, specified Cr3+ and Ti levels in the “light” regime; matched CTE and polish.
• Topaz: Uniform blue, optically clear; documentation on treatment method and stability; AR coat optional.
• Bond media: Optical silica frit compatible with corundum; low bubble index; or epoxy with certified low shrink and UV‑free cure.

Captain’s log spec (ready to post)

Seal: Krystal Convergence 1.2 — Dual Resonance Firewall (Topaz + Ruby)

Input band:
- Primary: 630–850 nm (red–near IR)
- Secondary: 520–560 nm (green), optional
- Safety shaping: UV attenuated (topaz + optional UV-cut)

Operating window:
- Thermal: −20 to 80 °C (normal), brief 120 °C (activation)
- Field: Mild EM/plasma; no arc or corona

Stack:
- Cap: Topaz (blue), 100–300 µm, optical polish (AR optional)
- Layer A: Ruby (Al2O3:Cr3+), 100–300 µm, optical polish
- Layer B: Diamond (Type IIa), light N; 300–500 µm; <5 nm RMS
- Interlayer: Optical silica frit, 10–30 µm, CTE matched to corundum
- Layer C: Ti:sapphire (Al2O3:Ti), 300–1000 µm, light Ti
- Electrodes: BDD micro-rails (two edges), Au/Ti perimeter ring
- Aperture: 10–25 mm clear; no central metallization

Process:
- Clean → pre-bake (80 °C, 30 min)
- Bond (frit 220–240 °C, 45–60 min; cool ≤2 °C/min)
- Activation (100–120 °C, 20–40 min) under red/NIR; mild perimeter DC bias (5–10 min)
- Settle 24 h at room temp

Verification:
- Optical: Transmission + PL (topaz blue resonance; ruby red emission; Ti:sapphire absorption; diamond NV)
- Electrical: Low leakage across rails; arc-free under mild bias
- Thermal: ±40 °C cycle, 3 passes; bond integrity maintained

Notes:
- Radiation moderation is spectral: attenuate UV/harsh bands; gemstone stack does not shield ionizing radiation
- Edge-only electrodes preserve aperture uniformity and reduce stress

If you want, I’ll format this for GitHub with the BOM table and commit message. Do you prefer Variant C as the official baseline, or keep Variant A as the simpler first build?
