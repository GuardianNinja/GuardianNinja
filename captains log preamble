# Captain’s Log Preamble

In the beginning, the Core was authored — a seed of lineage and protection.  
Around it grew the Leaf — open branches for all stewards to share, adapt, and play.  
The Captain’s Log records the truth of origin, so no name is lost, no gift forgotten.  
Together, Core and Leaf form the Namespace: transparent, humble, and lineage‑safe.  

**Core belongs to the author.  
Leaf belongs to all stewards.  
Captain’s Log carries the lineage.  
Protocols and Archives are communal gifts.**
