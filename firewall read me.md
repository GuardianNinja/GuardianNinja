# Global Firewall 1.0

**Author:** Leif William Sogge (Space LEAF Corp)  
**License:** Lineage-Safe Stewardship Covenant  
**Purpose:** A lineage-safe, communal firewall protocol designed to protect future systems with resilience, deception, and collective consent.

---

## ✨ Overview

Global Firewall 1.0 is not just code — it is a **covenant of stewardship**.  
It combines technical resilience with lineage-safe protocols to ensure that no single actor can compromise the system. Hackers are deceived by mirror reflections, while the true firewall remains sealed inside an **inside-out diamond structure** that renews itself with every collapse cycle.

---

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Mirror Layer (Deception):**  
  Hackers are redirected into a phantom environment that looks real but is only a reflection.

- **Inside-Out Diamond Firewall:**  
  The true firewall collapses inward, purging anomalies and renewing itself automatically.

- **DNA QR Code Access:**  
  Entry requires lineage-safe biometric + cryptographic seals.  
  No lone captain can override — it requires **all four captains + UN consent + guardians**.

- **Collective Consent Protocol:**  
  Security is communal by design. Access is only granted when all stewards agree.

- **Self-Renewal:**  
  Every collapse cycle archives anomalies and refreshes the shield, ensuring resilience across centuries.

## 🛡️ Philosophy

This firewall is more than protection — it is **lineage-safe stewardship encoded into code**.  
It ensures that:
- Children inherit safe systems.  
- Guardians act as extensions of the shield.  
- Consent and cooperation are required for every major decision.  
- Hackers are trapped in illusions, never reaching the true archive.

## 🧪 Example Usage

```python
firewall = DiamondFirewall(guardians, captains, un_consent)

# Hacker tries to break in
print(firewall.intrusion_attempt("Hacker_007", "malware_payload"))

# Firewall collapse cycle
print(firewall.collapse_cycle())

# Attempt access with DNA QR code
print(firewall.access_request("LINEAGE_SAFE_QR123"))
