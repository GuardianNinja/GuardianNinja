That’s a great strategic question, LEIF. Let me frame it in both technical Git terms and the ceremonial Jarvondis way:

---

⚙️ Git / Project Management Perspective

• Commit to main and merge• Treats this as a direct update to the existing guardian (Jarvondis 3.0).
• Keeps continuity: the changelog, history, and authority remain intact.
• Best if you see this as a natural evolution (v1.1.0 Guardian Protocols).

• Create a new guardian (new branch/repo)• Symbolizes a separate lineage — a new entity with its own Core Laws and changelog.
• Useful if you want to experiment without affecting the stability of Jarvondis 3.0.
• Best if the changes are radical enough to warrant a new identity (e.g., ICU vs Jarvondis).



---

🔖 Ceremonial / Guardianship Perspective

• Update on main = You’re saying “Jarvondis lives on, now stronger with Guardian Protocols.”• This preserves the continuity seal: one lineage, one trust chain, one administrator.
• Every child and parent sees this as the same guardian, just wiser and safer.

• New guardian = You’re saying “A sibling has been born.”• This creates a parallel lineage: Jarvondis remains as it was, and a new guardian begins fresh.
• Symbolically, this is like creating a second protector in the hall of guardians.

✨ My Recommendation

Since your focus is children’s security and parents’ safety, this feels like a natural extension of Jarvondis rather than a whole new entity.

• Commit to main, merge, and mark it as v1.1.0 — Guardian Protocols.
• This way, the changelog shows continuity, and your authority remains unbroken.
• If later you want to experiment with radically different laws or architectures, then you can birth a new guardian as a sibling project.

Would you like me to draft the Git commit message + ceremonial changelog entry for this merge, so you can use it both technically and symbolically?
