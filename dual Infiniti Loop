Transforming the 8D lock into B² infinity loops colliding at the center

You’re shifting from an 8D hypersphere constraint to a dynamic dual‑loop construct: two “infinity loops” (lemniscates) mirrored and coupled so they collide in the middle. We can formalize this as two embedded lemniscates (one for each loop) plus a collision coupling controlled by a squared parameter B².

Lemniscate foundations (the infinity loop)

Use the Bernoulli lemniscate as the base “∞” shape in a plane:

(x^2 + y^2)^2 = a^2(x^2 - y^2)


• Label: First loop in subspace 1L_1: \quad (x^2 + y^2)^2 - a^2(x^2 - y^2) = 0

• Label: Second loop in subspace 2L_2: \quad (u^2 + v^2)^2 - a^2(u^2 - v^2) = 0



These define two orthogonal figure‑eight loops. Parameter a controls each loop’s scale.

8D embedding with mirrored subspaces

Split 8D coordinates into two mirrored 4D sets:

• Loop A subspace: \((x, y, z, w)\) with lemniscate living in \((x,y)\), and \((z,w)\) acting as thickness or modulation.
• Loop B subspace: \((u, v, s, t)\) with lemniscate living in \((u,v)\), and \((s,t)\) acting as thickness or modulation.


Add gentle thickness constraints (optional but useful for 8D lock feel):

• Label: Thickness anchorsT_1:\; z^2 + w^2 = \rho_1^2,\quad T_2:\; s^2 + t^2 = \rho_2^2

Collision in the middle via B² coupling

To make the two infinity loops “collide in the middle,” couple the subspaces by their inner product and lock it with B²:

• Label: Central collision constraintC:\quad (x u + y v + z s + w t)^2 = B^2

• Interpretation:• When \(B = 0\), loops touch precisely at the shared center (true “collision in the middle”).
• When \(B \neq 0\), loops intersect on a central coupled locus whose “impact strength” is \(|B|\).
• Using \(B^2\) ensures symmetry and a nonnegative collision energy.

The full B² infinity‑collision lock (system)

• Infinity loops:L_1 = 0,\quad L_2 = 0

• Thickness (optional):T_1 = 0,\quad T_2 = 0

• Central collision:C = 0



Explicitly:

• Label: Loop A(x^2 + y^2)^2 - a^2(x^2 - y^2) = 0

• Label: Loop B(u^2 + v^2)^2 - a^2(u^2 - v^2) = 0

• Label: Optional thicknessz^2 + w^2 = \rho_1^2,\quad s^2 + t^2 = \rho_2^2

• Label: Collision lock(x u + y v + z s + w t)^2 = B^2

Quick forward–backward read (JD style)

• Forward: Check \(L_1=0, L_2=0, C=0\) (and \(T_1=0, T_2=0\) if used). If all constraints hold, the B² infinity lock is engaged.
• Backward (nudges): Gradients of each constraint steer coordinates onto the loops and into the central collision locus. For example, the collision term’s gradient contributes \(2(xu + yv + zs + wt)\cdot(u, v, s, t)\) to \((x,y,z,w)\), and symmetrically for \((u,v,s,t)\).
• Result: The system behaves like two mirrored lemniscates in 8D that meet at the center with adjustable collision energy \(B^2\).

If you want the hypersphere flavor retained

You can hybridize with the original 8D lock by adding a global radius:

• Label: Global radius (optional)x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 + u^2 + v^2 + s^2 + t^2 = R^2



This preserves the membrane feel while the lemniscate equations shape the “∞” geometry inside it.

If you want, I can turn this into a compact, dimension‑agnostic template where each “∞ loop” occupies a 2D slice, pairs are mirrored across subspaces, and B² controls the collision locus—scalable to 10D and beyond.
