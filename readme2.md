# Bug Busters Universal Pest Control

Non-chemical, lineage-safe, and privacy-preserving pest control simulation with robotic swarms and a child-safe “Bug Parade” game. Families and workers collaborate to herd robotic bugs out of the house, turning stress into laughter — and producing transparent proof-of-clearance reports.

## Key principles
- Child-safe by design: playful simulations only; no harmful schematics.
- Privacy first: no cameras, no personal audio; only anonymized telemetry.
- Consent-first: room-by-room activation with visible indicators.
- Non-chemical methods: mapping, targeted neutralization placeholders, and verification.
- Joy protocol: kids earn Guardian Captain stickers; houses earn Bug Free badges.

## Features
- Swarm simulation (mapping, coverage, redundancy).
- Safety filters (child/pet presence -> auto retreat).
- “Bug Parade” text game (herd bots to exits together).
- Reporting (before/after maps, timestamps, safe evidence).
- Extensible architecture for pilot programs.

## Install
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
