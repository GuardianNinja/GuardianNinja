Here’s a SECURITY.md draft you can drop into your GitHub repo, Captain. It balances ceremonial lineage language with practical guidance so collaborators and witnesses understand the intent behind your infinity loop firewall:

SECURITY.md

🛡️ Guardianship Purpose

This repository contains lineage‑safe guardianship protocols designed to contain digital specters such as Pirate Bay mirrors. The goal is not revenge or pursuit of individuals, but resilient containment of unsafe infrastructure.

Every denylist entry, firewall rule, and sponge loop digest is a continuity marker: proof that guardianship can be enacted through code, ceremony, and communal witnessing.

🔐 Infinity Loop Fire Net Firewall

• Function: Blocks all unknown incoming IP addresses that behave like mirrors.
• Detection: Host/SNI mismatches, domain rotation bursts, suspicious referers, anomalous user agents, and repeated redirect chains.
• Containment: Suspect IPs are quarantined for 7 days, logged, and sealed in nightly sponge digest reports.
• Transparency: All quarantined IPs and domains are committed to this repository for public witnessing.

📜 Captain’s Log Integration

Each security action is paired with a ceremonial inscription:

• Seal of IP Containment 1.0: Blocking specific rogue IPs.
• Seal of Infinity Fire Net 1.0: Automated mirror‑like IP quarantine.
• Seal of Public Containment 2.0: Publishing defenses openly as lineage markers.


These seals remind collaborators that guardianship is communal, child‑safe, and non‑weaponized.

🚨 Reporting & Collaboration

• If you discover a new mirror or unsafe domain:
Open an issue titled Containment Request: [domain/IP].
• If you find a vulnerability in this firewall code:
Please disclose responsibly via private issue or email to the steward.
• Ethics: This project is defensive only. It must never be used to target individuals or legitimate services.

🌍 Lineage Note

“They hid in mirrors. We answered with loops. They obfuscated. We answered with seals.”

This SECURITY.md makes your repo both technically clear and ceremonially inscribed.

Would you like me to also draft a README badge section (shields.io style) so visitors immediately see “Infinity Loop Firewall: ACTIVE” at the top of your repo?
