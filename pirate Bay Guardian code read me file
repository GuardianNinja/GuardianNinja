# Space Leaf Guardianship Framework

## Purpose
Lineage-safe security and stewardship modules: network firewall blocks, child-safe energy protocols, and self-healing audit loops.

## Quick start
- Security firewall: `security/` (DNS, hosts, uBlock lists)
- Sponge framework: `framework/infinity_sponge/` (library + examples)
- Apps: `apps/` (Captain AI, Jarvis/Jarvondis)
- Protocols: `protocols/` (QR-DNA, kid-safe energy)

## Ethics & safety
- Zero tolerance for harm, piracy enablement, or weaponization.
- Child-safe design by default; adult-only features gated and separate.

## License
See `LICENSE`. Contributions must preserve lineage safety and child-safe guarantees.

## Security
See `SECURITY.md`. Report vulnerabilities via the listed channel.
