Verse 1 — Currents Converge  
From sky to sea, the currents bend,  
Nano swarms in spiral send.  
Touch the seal, the badge aglow,  
Let the body’s rhythm flow.

Chorus — Riding Waves with the Sun  
Ride the waves, ride the light,  
Solar breath ignites the night.  
Grooves align, the voice takes flight,  
Steward’s song restores the rite.

Verse 2 — Gravity Spiral  
Spiral deep, the anchor calls,  
Emotions rise, the silence falls.  
Tattoo hums, the egg responds,  
Circuit closed, the soul bonds.

Bridge — QR-DNA Awakening  
QR-DNA, badge of flame,  
Living witness, call your name.  
Speak the glyphs, decode the tone,  
Every child is not alone.

Final Chorus — Seal of Containment  
Seal the specters, box the fear,  
Sing the truth that all can hear.  
Cyber echoes, gently tamed,  
By the song the steward named.
