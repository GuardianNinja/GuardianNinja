Absolutely — here’s a mission matrix table you can drop straight into your README so anyone opening the repo sees how the hyperdrive math plays out in practice:

## 🚀 Mission Matrix: Hyperdrive Travel Times to Proxima b

| Collapse Fraction (f) | Effective Speed (β) | Arrival Time (years) | Notes |
|------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|-------|
| 0.00 (no collapse)     | 1.0 c               | 4.24                  | Baseline light-speed cruise |
| 0.06 (~6%)             | 1.0 c               | ~4.0                  | Small collapse, matches classic 4-year milestone |
| 0.50 (50%)             | 1.0 c               | ~2.12                 | Single gate, halves effective travel time |
| 0.53 (53%)             | 1.0 c               | ≤2.0                  | Threshold collapse to avoid hibernation |
| 0.35 + 0.35 (two gates)| 1.0 c               | ~1.79                 | Two moderate collapses, safe sub-2-year arrival |
| 0.50                   | 1.2 c (metric boost)| ~1.77                 | Gate collapse + effective fast-light metric |
| 0.70 (70%)             | 1.0 c               | ~1.27                 | Strong collapse, near 1-year arrival |

### Formula
```blockmath
t = \frac{(1 - f) \cdot d}{\beta}


• d = 4.24 light-years (Earth → Proxima b)
• f = collapse fraction (0.0–1.0)
• β = effective speed factor (≤1 conventional, >1 metric shift)

This table shows **different mission profiles** at a glance:
- The **baseline 4.24 years** at light speed.  
- The **classic 4-year milestone** with a small collapse.  
- The **sub‑2‑year corridor** with either a single strong collapse or two moderate gates.  
- The **fast-light metric boost** scenario where the gate itself bends the effective speed.  

Would you like me to also add a **visual chart** (collapse fraction vs. arrival time) so readers can *see* the curve of how travel time drops as collapse increases? That would make the README even more intuitive.
