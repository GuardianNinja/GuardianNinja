Space LEAF Corp — Stewardship License Framework (Draft Blueprint)

A mission‑aligned license for public safety, government compatibility, and nonprofit integrity

---

1. Purpose of the License

This license governs the use of Space LEAF Corp software, frameworks, and identity‑routing systems.
Its goals are:

• to protect public safety
• to ensure ethical and lawful use
• to support the Space Cadet Program through voluntary donations
• to allow government agencies to integrate the system without compromising security
• to maintain the integrity of the LEAF Coin mission‑earning ecosystem


This section sets the tone: stewardship, not exploitation.

---

2. Ownership and Nonprofit Status

• All software, documentation, and frameworks are owned by Space LEAF Corp, a nonprofit organization dedicated to education, stewardship, and public safety.
• The system may not be sold, resold, or commercially exploited.
• Donations are permitted and encouraged; all donations support the Space Cadet Program and related educational initiatives.


This keeps your work mission‑aligned and prevents corporate misuse.

---

3. Authorized Users

This license allows use by:

• Federal, state, and local government agencies
• Educational institutions
• Nonprofit organizations
• Certified mission participants
• Approved developers working under Space LEAF Corp guidelines


Unauthorized individuals or entities may not access, deploy, or modify the system.

This is where you establish who is allowed in the room.

---

4. Government‑Safe Use Clause

Government agencies may:

• integrate the system into existing workflows
• use the identity‑routing framework
• run FAAO‑style mission logic
• participate in LEAF Coin mission validation


But they may not:

• extract personal data
• create derivative systems that bypass safety controls
• use the system for surveillance
• modify the core identity or routing logic


This protects your architecture from being twisted into something harmful.

---

5. Privacy, Data Protection, and Subpoena‑Only Access

• No personal data may be accessed, exported, or analyzed without a valid court subpoena.
• No backdoors, hidden admin accounts, or unauthorized monitoring tools may be added.
• All data access must be logged, auditable, and tied to a lawful purpose.
• Violations trigger immediate revocation of license rights.


This is your ethical backbone.

---

6. LEAF Coin Mission‑Earning Rules

• LEAF Coin is earned only through verified, successful missions.
• Missions must be lawful, safe, and aligned with Space LEAF Corp’s educational or stewardship goals.
• No entity may “print,” “mint,” or artificially inflate LEAF Coin.
• Government agencies may participate in mission validation but may not control the currency.


This keeps the currency fair, transparent, and abuse‑proof.

---

7. Prohibited Uses

The system may not be used for:

• unauthorized access to government systems
• surveillance or tracking of individuals
• military targeting
• commercial exploitation
• political manipulation
• data harvesting
• any activity that endangers public safety


This is your hard boundary line.

---

8. Enforcement and Penalties

Violations may result in:

• immediate termination of license
• civil penalties
• criminal referral
• fines for misuse
• permanent ban from future access


This gives the license real teeth.

---

9. Liability and Warranty

• Space LEAF Corp provides the system “as‑is” without warranties.
• Users assume responsibility for compliance with laws and regulations.
• Space LEAF Corp is not liable for misuse, unauthorized access, or derivative modifications.


Standard legal protection for you and your nonprofit.

---

10. Donation Clause

• All donations made through approved channels go directly to the Space Cadet Program.
• Donations do not grant special access, privileges, or influence.
• Donors may receive public acknowledgment if they choose.
