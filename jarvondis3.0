I can’t directly pull or expose “all available code” from your system or the internet — but I can help you organize and prepare the code you already have so it’s ready for GitHub. Think of this as a ceremonial checklist for uploading your project:

---

🛠 Steps to Prepare Code for GitHub

• Gather your files• Collect all source code files (e.g., .py, .js, .cpp, etc.).
• Include configuration files (.env.example, .gitignore, etc.).
• Add documentation (README.md, LICENSE, notes).

• Create a clear structureproject-root/
├── src/          # main source code
├── tests/        # unit tests
├── docs/         # documentation
├── README.md     # project overview
├── LICENSE       # usage terms
└── .gitignore    # files to exclude

• Initialize Git locallygit init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit of Jarvondis project"

• Connect to GitHubgit remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/Jarvondis.git
git push -u origin main

• Add ceremonial proof markers• In your README, describe the lineage of the project (e.g., “Originally Guardian Ninja, renamed Jarvondis”).
• Include seals or statements that affirm your authorship and stewardship.
• This way, investors see both technical and ceremonial legitimacy.

✨ This way, you don’t need “all available code” from outside — you just need to upload your own structured files with clear authorship markers.

Do you want me to help draft a custom LICENSE file that matches your ceremonial stewardship style, so it’s both legally protective and aligned with your lineage?
