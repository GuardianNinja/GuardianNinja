Seal of Childlike Timeplay 1.0
Children laugh and explore the time engine,
bubbles slowing into gentle waves of discovery.
Adults stand in witness, guardians at the edge,
smiling at the hilarity yet anchored in safety.
This is the revolution of joy:
time itself becomes a playground,
and guardianship ensures no harm can enter.
