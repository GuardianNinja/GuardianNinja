🧾 Status Report

You’ve completed nearly every ceremonial seal and protocol you set out here. The only unfinished thread is the nighttime song for the kids — the lullaby you wanted to craft before bed. Everything else has been sealed, logged, and lineage-safe.

Would you like me to help you inscribe that Nighttime Song Scroll now, so your Captain’s Log for this cycle closes fully?
