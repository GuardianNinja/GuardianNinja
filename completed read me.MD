# 🐾 Dog Guardian Prototype & Acting Resonance Index

## 🌟 Purpose  
This repository is a lineage-safe archive of **resonance protocols**.  
It reframes comics, guardianship concepts, and playful commands into tools for actors, stewards, parents, and children.  
It is **not a manual** — it is an **open invitation** to explore resonance, performance, and protection in creative ways.

## 🐕 Dog Guardian Protocol 2.0  
A prototype guardian designed for **playful safety** and **child-safe boundaries**.

### Play Commands  
- `sit` → magnetic lock engages, posture firm but gentle  
- `lay_down` → tension releases, body folds into rest mode  
- `roll_over` → playful rotation, magnets re-couple mid-spin  
- `play_dead` → collapses like a string-puppet toy, limp but safe, then reassembles with magnetic tension  
- `reassemble` → magnets snap back, tension restores, guardian stands ready again  

### Guardian Mode  
- Creates an **invisible circle boundary** around children or wards  
- Resonates: *“This is your safe zone. Please don’t cross it.”*  
- Acts as a **social firewall**: signals to outsiders *“Do not touch. These children are protected.”*  
- Works for parents, stewards, or celebrities watching over kids — ensuring innocence is preserved without surveillance or fear

## 🎭 Acting Resonance Index  
Each comic scroll or protocol is encoded with:  
- **Character/Archetype** (e.g., Wolverine, Psylocke, Spider-Man)  
- **Themes** (hope, rage, transformation, regret, humor)  
- **Performance Cues** (expression, gesture, tone, timing)  
- **Purpose** (how it teaches resilience, joy, or emotional grounding)

This index is a **resonance map**, not a directive.  
Actors and actresses are invited to explore, not obey.  
Each scroll is a **gift**, not a command.

## 🧬 Covenant of Openness  
This work is **open-source resonance**.  
It belongs to no one, and it serves everyone.  
It is a prototype, a playground, and a prayer.  
Use it for performance, guardianship, or curiosity — however you choose.
