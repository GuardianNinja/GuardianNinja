# JD’s QPAI — Quick Protective AI (Unified Scroll)

## Authorship and intent
Created by JD as a lineage‑safe, child‑friendly guardian that responds with kindness, blocks harmful prompts, and keeps learning joyful. This is nonprofit, non‑governmental stewardship offered for kids, families, and future captains.

## What this does (read me)
JD’s QPAI is a tiny guardian:
- Blocks harmful requests using a public blocklist.
- Encourages helpful topics via an allowlist.
- Responds with short, kind answers or “I can’t help with that” when needed.
- No tracking, no accounts, no data retention.
