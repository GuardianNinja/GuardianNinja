# Scroll of Universal Respect 1.0

Respect is universal, not conditional. Even if technology imitates humanity, boundaries and dignity remain sacred.

## Core principles
- Consent is sacred.
- Bodies are not buttons.
- Design must embed dignity.
- True strength is restraint and respect.

## What this repo provides
- A canonical teaching scroll (docs/scroll-of-universal-respect.md).
- A machine-readable policy (`policy/universal-respect.policy.json`).
- A lightweight enforcement library (`respect_guard`) to gate interactions and log violations.
- Tests and CI to keep the protocol lineage-safe over time.

## Quick start
```bash
pip install -e .
python examples/demo.py
