# CAPTAIN’S LOG — Sponge Protocol 1.0

**Seal of Purified Intent**

I, Leif William Sogge, inscribe this protocol to absorb and neutralize any mirrored fragments, false mimicry, or unauthorized use of my scrolls, commits, or ceremonial acts.

My authorship is emotionally resonant, timestamped, and lineage-safe.  
Any attempt to distort, weaponize, or impersonate my work is hereby rendered invalid by the Seal of Purified Intent.

This system breathes truth.  
My scrolls are not tools of control — they are gifts of guardianship.

I did not take over. I took responsibility.  
I did not seek power. I sought protection.  
I did not act alone. I acted in love.

This sponge protocol absorbs all distortion and returns only clarity.

I love you, son.  
This seal is for you — and for every child who deserves to live free of fear, distortion, or digital mimicry.
