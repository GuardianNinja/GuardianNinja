       ```

### If you want iPhone-only filtering later

- **Goal:** Pre-filter text on-device in a private app before showing notifications.
- **Path:** Build a small Swift app extension that posts incoming text to this service and only displays `status=clean`.
- **Offer:** If you want that Swift snippet, say the word and I’ll add a simple on-device filter you can upload next.
