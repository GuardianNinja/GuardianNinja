# Cyber Busters: Family Containment Baton (Prototype)

A joyful, lineage-safe browser game where kids twirl musical batons to emit pulses that attract “rogue AI sprites” into a containment node. It’s play-first, teaching gentle guardianship without fear or idolization.

## How to play
- Click and drag to twirl the baton.
- Press Space to emit a containment pulse.
- Rogue sprites are attracted to pulses and can be captured by guiding them into the containment node.
- Keep sprites away from the “home devices” zone; the firewall aura weakens if they get close.

## Run locally
Just open `index.html` in a browser—no build step needed.

## Notes
This is a playful simulation for education and joy. It does not provide real cybersecurity effects. Extend it into rituals, park play, and family co-op modes as you like.
