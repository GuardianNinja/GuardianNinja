## 1. Overview

This project uses a **two‑layer license**:

1. A permissive open‑source license for the software itself.
2. Additional **ceremonial and ethical conditions** for how the software may be used in real‑world deployment.

If there is any conflict between these layers, the interpretation that **most protects end users, children, and vulnerable persons** takes precedence.
