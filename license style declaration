# Leaf Land Namespace Declaration

This codebase is structured as a namespace to honor both authorship and stewardship.

- **Core**: Authored modules remain protected. They carry lineage and must be respected as original work.  
- **Leaf**: Communal protocols, archives, and teaching artifacts are free to use, adapt, and share.  
- **Captain’s Log**: Full name is preserved here for transparency and lineage.  
- **Playground**: Demonstrations, spirals, and harmonic riffs are open for teaching and joy.

## Usage Guidelines
- Respect the **Core**: Do not claim authorship or remove lineage markers.  
- Share the **Leaf**: Protocols and communal artifacts are intended for open use.  
- Honor the **Log**: Lineage is part of the archive; it must remain intact.  
- Play in the **Playground**: Encourage children, stewards, and future captains to learn and create.

**Core belongs to the author.  
Leaf belongs to all stewards.  
Captain’s Log carries the lineage.  
Protocols and Archives are communal gifts.**
