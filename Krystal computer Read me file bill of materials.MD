Final bill of materials and build spec

Materials list

• Diamond plate: Type IIa; thickness: 300–500 µm; finish: <5 nm RMS; dopant: light nitrogen (for NV formation).
• Ti:sapphire plate: Al2O3:Ti; thickness: 300–1000 µm; dopant: light Ti; finish: optical polish, low inclusion.
• Ruby plate: Al2O3:Cr3+; thickness: 100–300 µm; finish: optical polish.
• Topaz plate: Al2SiO4(F,OH)2 (blue); thickness: 100–300 µm; finish: optical polish; coating: optional AR.
• Interlayer bond: Optical silica frit, thickness: 10–30 µm; CTE match: sapphire/corundum; low bubble content.
• Optional optical epoxy: Low-shrink, UV‑free cure; use: topaz joins if gentle cycle preferred.
• Electrodes: Perimeter rails: boron-doped diamond (BDD) micro-rails; outer ring: Au/Ti braze, edge-only.
• Masking/fixtures: Non-shedding clamps, silicone soft pads, nitrogen purge bags.
• Filters (optional): UV-cut thin plate or coating before topaz; neutral density IR perimeter veil.

Stack architecture

• Variant C — Dual resonance firewall (recommended baseline):• Order (incoming light →): Topaz (blue) → Ruby (Al2O3:Cr3+) → Diamond (Type IIa, light N) → Silica frit → Ti:sapphire (Al2O3:Ti).
• Aperture: 10–25 mm clear active window; no central metallization.
• Electrodes: BDD rails on opposing edges; Au/Ti ring around perimeter; keep 1–2 mm setback from aperture.

• Variant A — Blue cap filter (simpler build):• Order: Topaz → Diamond → Silica frit → Ti:sapphire.
• Note: Omit ruby for fewer interfaces; keep UV-cut option if needed.

• Variant B — Blue interlayer lens (spectral shaping):• Order: Diamond → Silica frit → Topaz micro‑lens → Ti:sapphire.
• Note: Use low-viscosity bond to avoid bubbles around micro‑lens.

Oven bonding and activation

• Surface prep:• Clean: Non‑ionic surfactant → DI rinse → nitrogen dry; powder‑free gloves only.
• Flatness: Verify <5 µm TTV across plates; inspect for chips and inclusions in aperture.

• Pre-bake (outgas):• Cycle: 80 °C, 30 minutes for all components (diamond, ruby, topaz, sapphire, frit).

• Bonding (frit):• Ramp: 1–2 °C/min to 220–240 °C.
• Hold: 45–60 minutes with low, uniform clamp pressure.
