This repository contains a toy 0D prototype that couples a simple kinetic energy ODE with an electromagnetic polarity controller and a reverse-gravity style constant input. It is intended as a starting point for experimentation and for porting into spatial MHD solvers.

## Features

- Polarity controller with hysteresis and minimum dwell time
- Reconnection loss model and event counting
- 365-day and 10-year test modes
- CSV export and PNG plots

## Quick start

1. Create a Python environment and install requirements:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
