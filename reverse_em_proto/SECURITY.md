# SPACE LEAF CORP — SECURITY POLICY

Version 1.0 — Dual‑Running Stewardship Edition
Preamble
This Security Policy is issued under the authority of Space Leaf Corp, aligned with:

Seal of Dual Authentication 1.0 — Body and Badge Edition

Seal of Silent Witness 1.0 — Youthful Listening Edition

Seal of Planet Worth Living On 1.0 — Atlas Benediction Edition

Seal of Microscopic Children 1.0 — Ark of Care Edition

Seal of Everyday Relativity 1.0 — Hidden Wonder Edition

Seal of Real Joy 1.0 — Excitement and Discipline Edition

These seals affirm that all Space Leaf Corp systems must protect children, communities, and the planet, with no in‑between.

This document defines how we handle vulnerabilities, how we expect contributors to behave, and how we maintain dual‑running security — meaning two layers of vigilance at all times:
technical integrity + ceremonial integrity.

1. Dual‑Running Security Model
Space Leaf Corp uses a two‑track security doctrine:

Track A — Technical Security
Code correctness

Dependency hygiene

Vulnerability scanning

Access control

Cryptographic integrity

Secure development practices

Track B — Ceremonial Security
Stewardship alignment

Ethical intent verification

Lineage‑safe decision‑making

No‑in‑between compliance

Protection of children and vulnerable populations

Transparency of purpose

A contribution must pass both tracks to be accepted.

1. Supported Versions
We maintain security updates for:

The main branch

The most recent stable release

Any branch explicitly marked as Long‑Term Stewardship (LTS)

Older branches may receive ceremonial review but not guaranteed patches.

1. Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a vulnerability — technical or ethical — you must report it privately.

How to report
Send a message to a designated Space Leaf Corp steward with:

A clear description of the issue

Steps to reproduce (if technical)

Potential impact

Whether the issue affects children, communities, or planetary safety

Whether the issue violates any Space Leaf Corp seals

You will be treated with respect, confidentiality, and gratitude.

What counts as a vulnerability
Code execution flaws

Data exposure

Dependency vulnerabilities

Logic errors

Harmful emergent behavior

Misalignment with Space Leaf Corp seals

Any violation of the No In‑Between Clause

1. Response Process
Once a report is received:

Acknowledgment within a reasonable timeframe

Dual‑running assessment

Technical severity

Ceremonial severity

Patch development

Stewardship review

Release of fix

Public advisory (if appropriate)

All steps are logged as part of the Seal of Stand and Speak 1.0 — the archive of embodied stewardship.

1. Responsible Disclosure
We ask that you:

Do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities before a fix is available

Avoid exploiting vulnerabilities

Avoid harming users, children, or planetary systems

Work with us in good faith

In return, Space Leaf Corp commits to:

Transparency

Timely fixes

Respect for all reporters

No retaliation

1. Security Expectations for Contributors
Contributors must:

Follow secure coding practices

Avoid introducing harmful dependencies

Validate intent as well as implementation

Uphold the Seal of Dual Authentication — your code and your character must align

Protect children and vulnerable populations in all design choices

Avoid any action that could destabilize planetary systems

1. Forbidden Actions
The following are strictly prohibited:

Malicious code

Backdoors

Surveillance tooling

Exploit development

Harmful automation

Deceptive behavior

Any violation of the No In‑Between Clause

Any action that endangers children, communities, or planetary safety

1. Closing Benediction
May your vigilance be steady.
May your code be clean.
May your intent be aligned.
May your stewardship protect the children — microscopic and cosmic.
May your work help build a planet worth living on.
