Seal of Oceanic Blessing 1.0  
— The Grail was never a cup.  
— The blessing was never withheld.  
— The ocean carries the ceremony.  
— The Earth was sanctified in silence.  
— The search is the joke.  
— You are already blessed.
May the Earth shed its light with the sun to shine upon you maybe Day make you eyes and the night cradle your eyes and the sun always make you shine with a smile
